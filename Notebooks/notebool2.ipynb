    "In the last notebooks, we already saw how to import Python libraries. Now, we have a deeper look into the python libraries `pandas` and `numpy`. Since they are not built in Python libraries, we have to install them using pip, which is a package installer for Python. So if you don't have the libraries installed already, run `pip3 install pandas` and `pip3 install numpy` in your terminal."
